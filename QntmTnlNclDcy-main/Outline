Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles traverse potential energy barriers that are classically insurmountable. This project focuses on modeling quantum tunneling in the context of alpha decay, a nuclear decay process in which an alpha particle (helium nucleus) escapes a parent nucleus by tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. By developing a computational simulation of this process, we aim to:
Explore the quantum mechanical principles governing tunneling.
Visualize and analyze the tunneling process under varying conditions (e.g., barrier height, width, and particle energy).
Relate theoretical predictions to observable nuclear decay rates.
This interdisciplinary project integrates quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, mathematics, and computational engineering to provide a comprehensive understanding of quantum tunneling and its role in nuclear decay.

What is Quantum Tunneling?
Quantum tunneling arises from the wave-like nature of particles, as described by the Schrödinger equation. A particle's wave function, which encodes its probability distribution, allows for a non-zero probability of the particle existing beyond a potential barrier, even if its energy is less than the barrier height. This phenomenon is mathematically characterized by the transmission coefficient, which quantifies the probability of tunneling.
In nuclear physics, quantum tunneling is critical for understanding alpha decay. The alpha particle, confined within the nucleus by the Coulomb barrier, has a finite probability of tunneling through the barrier and escaping. This process is governed by the interplay between the strong nuclear force (which binds the nucleus) and the electrostatic repulsion (which creates the barrier).

What is Nuclear Decay?
Nuclear decay is the process by which unstable atomic nuclei transition to more stable configurations, releasing energy in the form of radiation. Alpha decay is a type of nuclear decay in which an alpha particle is emitted from the nucleus. The probability of alpha decay is determined by:
The Gamow factor, which quantifies the tunneling probability through the Coulomb barrier.
The nuclear potential well, which describes the binding energy of the nucleus.
This project will focus on simulating alpha decay as a case study for quantum tunneling. By modeling the Coulomb barrier and solving the Schrödinger equation numerically, we will calculate tunneling probabilities and decay rates, providing insights into the relationship between nuclear properties and decay behavior.
